#Stocks
Sample app that is a re-creation of the Apple Watch Stocks app, powered by IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation Server.  

The native iOS application requires **Xcode 6.4** running on a Mac to compile and deploy on either the iOS Simulator or on a development device.  Xcode 6.4 is required to target Apple WatchOS 1.0, and can be downloaded from http://developer.apple.com.
