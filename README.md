# MobileFirst-WatchKit
A collection of simple apps that use IBM MobileFirst and target the Apple Watch.  These samples target Apple WatchOS 1.0.  Apple WatchOS 2.0 requires bitcode support enabled, which is not *yet* availble for IBM MobileFirst libraries.  Targeting WatchOS 1.0 requires Xcode 6.4 which is available from http://developer.apple.com
